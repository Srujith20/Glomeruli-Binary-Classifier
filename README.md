### Sclerotic Glomeruli
Sclerotic glomeruli refer to a condition where the glomerulus, a tiny blood vessel in the kidney, undergoes sclerosis, which involves the hardening and scarring of the tissues. This condition is often associated with various renal diseases and can impact kidney function. Identification of sclerotic glomeruli through machine learning models can aid in understanding and diagnosing renal diseases.

### Non-sclerotic Glomeruli
Non-sclerotic glomeruli, on the other hand, represent glomeruli without the hardening and scarring characteristic of sclerosis. Understanding the differences between sclerotic and non-sclerotic glomeruli is crucial in the medical domain for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.
